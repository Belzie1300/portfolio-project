    <h2>About</h2>
    <h1>Belinda</h1>
    <p>
      Prior to this I've worked in Payroll. As much as I had enjoyed working in
      Payroll, I felt there was a lack in growth and especially, creativity! I
      love looking for ways to work more efficiently. Using excel and finding
      hot keys in different programs was my way of expressing creativity and
      efficiency. I've felt that I wanted to do more and to be more creative.
      Therefore, I took the courage to learn coding and fell in love with it! I
      find coding exciting and incredibly fulfilling, especially when I can see
      my own work 'come to life'. The constant problem solving and the
      opportunity to learn something new everyday is very appealing. I wish I
      had done this sooner.
